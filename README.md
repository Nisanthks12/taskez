## Reflection

This was a 3-day long project built as a part of the FrontEnd Founding Engineer Role interview of [YouShd](https://www.youshd.com/). The project design was shared as a figma file. Project goals included making the frontend of a To-Do app built using React. 

Originally I wanted to build an app and host it on the internet that allowed users to efficiently manage their everyday task using a Kan-ban board style User-Interface. I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate.  


The main challenge of the this project was that I was a complete beginner in React and I had to learn it from scratch. I had to learn the basics of React and then learn how to use React Router and MDB UI Kit. I also had to learn how to use React Hooks to manage the state of the app. I had to learn all of this in 3 days. I was able to complete only the UI and skeletal functionalities of the project within 3 days and I learned a lot about React in the process.

I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes. In the next iteration I plan on making the app interactive and functional for users with at least some basic functionalities.
